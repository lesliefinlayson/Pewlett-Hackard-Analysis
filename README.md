# Pewlett Hackard:  Preparing for the "Silver Tsunami"

## Project Overview

Because a significantly large number of Pewlett Hackard's employees and managers are approaching retirement age, Pewlett Hackard is looking ahead to "future-proof" the company.  One key question is whether or not there are currently an adequete number of employees that can be trained through the Mentorship Program to backfill the positions that will become open. To address this question, this assignment collected the following data:

  1.  The number of retiring employees by title
  2.  The employees eligible for the Mentorship Program

## Results

_The Number of Retiring Employees by Title_

Knowing how many employees and managers are approaching retirement age by title provides more specific information about Pelwett Hackard's upcoming staffing needs.
