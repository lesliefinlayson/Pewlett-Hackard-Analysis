# Pewlett-Hackard:  Retirement and Mentorship Eligibility Analysis

## Project Overview

Because a significantly large number of Hewlett Packard's employees and managers are approaching retirement age, Hewlett Packard is looking ahead to "future-proof" the company.  This analysis collects data for two areas of interest:

  1.  The number of retiring employees by title
  2.  The employees eligible for the Mentorship Program
