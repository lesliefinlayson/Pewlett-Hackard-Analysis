# Pewlett Hackard:  Preparing for the "Silver Tsunami"

## Project Overview

Because a significantly large number of Pewlett Hackard's employees and managers are approaching retirement age, Pewlett Hackard is looking ahead to "future-proof" the company.  One key question is whether or not there are currently an adequete number of employees that can be trained through the Mentorship Program to backfill the positions that will become open. To address this question, this assignment collected the following data:

  1.  The number of retiring employees by title
  2.  The employees eligible for the Mentorship Program

## Results

_The Number of Retiring Employees by Title_

Knowing how many employees and managers are approaching retirement age by title provides more specific information about Pelwett Hackard's upcoming staffing needs.

These numbers indicate the following:

•	A high number of Senior Engineers will be retiring in the near future and of concern

•	A high number of Senior Staff will be retiring in the near future and of concern

•	A moderate number of Engineers, Staff, and Technique Leaders will be retiring

•	A low number of Assistant Engineers are retiring and very few Managers

 _The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program_
 
 The assignment to collect the employees who are eligible for the Mentorship Program includes current employees with birth dates between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. 
 The following document was generated (please click):

  [mentorship eligibility](data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)
  
  Viewing this document shows:
  
•	There are a large number of employees who satisfy the conditions of currently employed and born in 1965

•	Scrolling to the end of the document shows that there are 2382 entries for employees.  

•	Reading through the titles shows that the eligible employees have a variety of titles.

•	Reading through the to_dates (hire dates) show that the eligible employees have been with the company varying lengths of time.

 ## Summary
Completing the assignment as it was originally defined gives a good indication of what departments (by employee title) are going to be strongly impacted by the upcoming wave of retirements.  Determining if there are enough employees currently employed to backfill these positions is not clear with the current analysis.  The list of employees eligible for the Mentorship program is limited in several ways:

•	Duplicates were not removed

•	The data is orderd by employee number rather than by department

•	The count was not generated
 
 To address these limitations, an additional table was created with these results:

Comparing this table with the table showing retiring employees, it becomes clear that there are not enough eligible employees for the Mentorship Program to backfill the positions that will become open.  For example, over 13,000 Senior Engineers are retiring and only 169 Senior Engineers are eligible for the mentorship program.  

Other measures will be needed to backfill the positions that will be made open from the "silver tsunami".  The pool of current eligible employees for the Mentorship Program can be increased by increasing the birthdate rate to more than one year.  It may be advisable as well to consider hiring additional employees.  Also, positions can be individually reviewed to see if they all are necessary, can some not be backfilled and Pewlett Hackard able to maintain its standards of excellence.
